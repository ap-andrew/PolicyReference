<p>Raising fault can potentially save you many late hours trying to reproduce faults that occur in the runtime environment. For example, the rate limiting policy is unable to limit the number of API calls your application makes so it generates a failure. If the policy failure had been reported as a fault, the operation would either stop or require the fault-handling mechanism to handle the failure. Therefore, a typical use case involves returning a fault response to a request that cannot be processed.</p>
<p>In Apigee, you can configure your API with a Raise Fault policy that executes when an event occurs in the message flow that you would like to treat as an exception. &nbsp;The policy moves the message flow execution to the fault-handling flow, which in turn, returns a fault response. The fault handlers capture the fault variables (fault name, type, and category) from the policy execution and then handle each fault appropriately.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Apigee also provides a Raise Alert policy (see [node:187]). Use this policy to send an alert to the syslog when required.</p>
<p>You can attach a list of policies to the defined Raise Fault policy for processing in the fault-handling flow. In cases where fault handling must be specific to the application, endpoint, or operations, you can define fault handling at the attachment points. For more information on the fault-handling mechanism, see [node:184].</p>

<h2><a class="jumplink" name="schema"></a>Policy schema</h2>
<p>Each policy must conform to a policy schema. All policy constructs such as elements and attributes mentioned above are defined in a schema. To download the schema, <a href="/docs/download/file/fid/192">click here</a>.</p>

<h3>Raise Fault flow variables</h3>
<p>Flow variables play a pivotal role in message flow. These variables let advanced users customize the behavior of policies and flows, based on the headers or message content, or the context available in the flow. The following predefined flow variables are available after Raise Fault policy execution. For more information about flow variables, see [node:243].</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="table" style="width: 690px;">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th style="text-align: left;">Variable</th>
			<th style="text-align: left;">Type</th>
			<th style="text-align: left;">Permission</th>
			<th style="text-align: left;">Description</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>fault.name</td>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>Read-Only</td>
			<td>Returns the fault name in the error and if not available, an empty string.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>fault.type</td>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>Read-Only</td>
			<td>Returns the fault type in the error and if not available, an empty string.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>fault.category</td>
			<td>String</td>
			<td>Read-Only</td>
			<td>Returns the fault category in the error and if not available, an empty string.</td>

<p><b>Note:</b> These variables are used in the fault handling flow to handle each fault differently.</p>
