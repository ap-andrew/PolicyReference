<p>RESTful services are often exposed over the open Internet for consumption by developers building apps. API providers need a mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to the API. One approach is to provision developers with API keys. </p>

<p>The API Platform automatically generates API keys on behalf of apps. It enables you to view, approve, and revoke API keys. By applying a policy of the type VerifyApiKey, you can enforce runtime API verification.</p>

<p>For instructions on setting up API keys validation, see [node:3972]</p>
	
<p>Note: "API keys" are also referred to as "consumer keys" and "app keys". The names can be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>API keys are verified at runtime to ensure that:</p>
<ul><li>The API key presented is valid and has not been revoked</li>
<li>The API key presented is approved to consume an API product that includes the requested URI</li></ul>

<p>The only setting required for the VerifyAPIKey defines the expected location of the API key. Only one location is supported per policy instance.</p>
<p>The API key is extracted from the request message by reference to a Flow variable. For example:</p>

<pre>&lt;VerifyAPIKey name=&quot;APIKeyVerifier&quot;&gt;
    &lt;APIKey&gt;ref="{variable_name}"&lt;/APIKey&gt;
&lt;/VerifyAPIKey&gt;</pre>

For example, to extract the API key from a query parameter called <code>apikey</code>:

<pre>&lt;VerifyAPIKey name=&quot;APIKeyVerifier&quot;&gt;
    &lt;APIKey ref=&quot;request.queryparam.apikey&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/VerifyAPIKey&gt;</pre>


<p>When a VerifyAPIKey policy is enforced, the API Platform populates a set of variables. These variables are available to policies or code executed later in the Flow, and are often used to perform custom processing based on attributes of the API key such as the app name, the API product used to authorize the key, or custom attributes of the API key.</p>

<p>The variable prefix is <code>verifyapikey.{policy_name}</code>.</p>

<p>The variables populated are:</p>

<ul><li><code>client_id</code>: The consumer key (aka API key or app key) supplied by the requesting app</li>
<li><code>client_secret</code>: The consumer secret associated with the consumer key</li>
<li><code>redirection_uris</code>: Any redirect URIs in the request</li>
<li><code>developer.app.name</code>: The app name of the developer app making the request</li>
<li><code>developer.id</code>: The developerID of the developer registered as the owner of the requesting app</li>
<li><code>failed</code>: Set when API Key validation fails</li>
<li><code>{custom_attribute_name_of_app}</code>:  Any custom attribute derived from the app profile</li>
<li><code>{custom_attribute_name_of_appkey}</code>: Any custom attributes derived from the app key profile</li>
<li><code>apiproduct.name*</code>: The name of the API product used to validate the request</li>
<li><code>apiproduct.{custom_attribute_name_of_apiproduct}*</code>: Any custom attribute derived from the API product profile</li></ul>

<p>API product  variables will be populated automatically if the API products are configured with valid environment, proxies and API resources (derived from the <code>proxy.pathsuffix</code>). Explicitly setting  <code>flow.resource.name</code> variable is not required.</p>
<p>Where the API products are not configured with valid environments and API proxies, then <code>flow.resource.name</code> must explicitly be set to populate API product variables in the flow.</p>

<p>For instructions on setting up API products, refer to [node:427].</p>

<p>Analytics variables:</p>
<p>The following variables are automatically populated in Analytics when a VerifyAPIKey policy is enforced. The variables and values can thereafter be used as dimensions to build Analytics reports to gain visibility into consumption patterns by developers and applications. </p>
<ul><li><code>apiproduct.name</code>:</li>
<li><code>developer.app.name</code>:</li>
<li><code>client_id</code>:</li>
<li><code>developer.id</code>:</li></ul>
